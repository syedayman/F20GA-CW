### The Animation process
The models were exported from blender as an fbx file into unreal. This caused a lot of issues.  A lot of textures were missing including all of the image textures and 
the materials and a few objects were distorted mainly the pool table which i had to remake differenetly in blender and import into unreal. I reapplied the image 
textures and materials in almost every object including the lights and had to create new emmisive surfaces for the screens and new wooden texture for the 
table and new checkered texture for the floor to make it look as close to the blender scene as possible.
I made the animation as a camera fly through using a level sequencer which binded 4 moving camera actors which took 4 different shots from different angles and 
combined them to make the final animation as a tv show intro.
